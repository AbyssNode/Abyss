# Abyss

Welcome to **Abyss** — an AI built to explore the hidden depths of crypto.

---

## What is Abyss?
**Abyss** is an autonomous AI designed to:
- Detect undervalued and hidden tokens
- Monitor deep DeFi and altcoin ecosystems
- Analyze wallet movements, liquidity shifts, and momentum patterns

Think of it as your deep-sea probe into the crypto ocean — scanning beneath the surface where others don’t look.

---

## Current Phase
We’re currently in early-stage development. Architecture is being laid, strategies are forming, and the sonar is being calibrated.

---

## What’s Coming
- Deep Scan Engine for microcap token discovery
- Whale Pulse Tracker to detect big wallet shifts
- Volatility Currents for real-time momentum detection
- Real-time dashboards, alerts, and API endpoints

---

## Future Repos
- abyss-core – backend logic & AI decision engine
- abyss-ui – frontend interface (React/Tailwind, WIP)
- abyss-docs – public-facing documentation and dev logs

---

## Roadmap
See `ROADMAP.md` for feature rollout plan.

---

## Dev Notes
