# Versioning

Abyss follows semantic versioning:

- `MAJOR`: Breaking changes or major architectural shifts
- `MINOR`: New features that don’t break core use
- `PATCH`: Bug fixes, doc updates, performance tweaks

Example:  
`v0.2.1` → 2nd minor feature release, with 1 patch since

> All active signals are logged with their engine version to keep tracking consistent.
