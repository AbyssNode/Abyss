# System Architecture

Abyss is modular by design â€” each component serves a precise purpose in the AI-driven analysis flow:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**  
  Streams real-time data from DEXs, token APIs, and wallet movements.

- **Signal Core (AI)**  
  Triggers insights based on deep pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

- **Routing Engine**  
  Directs high-priority signals to the user, filtering noise.

- **Interface Layer** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Web-based control panel for configuring signals and visualizing analytics.
