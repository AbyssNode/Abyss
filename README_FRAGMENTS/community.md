# Community

Abyss is open-source and open-ended.

Ways to engage:
- Drop feature requests under GitHub Issues
- Join discussions on Discord (coming soon)
- Submit PRs for new detectors, filters, or datasets
- Share test cases and edge tokens you’ve found

We’re building this for those who go deeper.
