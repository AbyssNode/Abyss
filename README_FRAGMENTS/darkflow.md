# Darkflow (Experimental)

"Darkflow" refers to the unseen movement beneath the market surface.

Abyss is experimenting with:
- Detecting capital flow between wallets with no obvious price impact
- Clustering these flows to identify silent builds
- Mapping movement before volume shows up on-chain

Darkflow isn't about what's trending. It's about what's hiding.
