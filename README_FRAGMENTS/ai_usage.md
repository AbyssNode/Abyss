# How Abyss Uses AI

AI isn't just a buzzword here — it's the backbone.

- **Pattern Recognition**  
  Learns behaviors of pump & dump tokens vs. slow accumulators.

- **Anomaly Scanning**  
  Flags activity that doesn’t follow historical norms.

- **Trend Clustering**  
  Groups tokens showing correlated micro-trends across chains.

- **Predictive Ranking** *(Experimental)*  
  Ranks tokens by likelihood of breakout based on multi-factor inputs.
